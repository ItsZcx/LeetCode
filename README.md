# LeetCode Solutions
Welcome to my LeetCode Solutions Repository! This repository is dedicated to storing my personal solutions to various LeetCode problems that I have solved. It serves as a reference for my coding journey and showcases my problem-solving skills.

# Introduction
LeetCode is a popular online platform that provides a collection of coding challenges, ranging from *easy* to *hard*, to help individuals enhance their programming skills. This repository contains my own solutions to these challenges, which I have developed over time.

By sharing my solutions, I aim to provide insights into different approaches, algorithms, and data structures that can be used to solve a wide range of programming problems. However, it's important to note that these solutions reflect my own thought process and may not always be the most optimal or efficient ones.

# Organization
The folders are organized as follows:

<pre>
.
├── <b>Easy</b>
│   ├── [problem_name]
│   │  ├── README.md
│   │  ├── [problem_name].py
│   │  └── <b>others</b>
│   │       ├── .gitignore
│   │       └── ...
│   └── ...
├── <b>Medium</b>
│   ├── [problem_name]
│   │  ├── README.md
│   │  ├── [problem_name].py
│   │  └── <b>others</b>
│   │       ├── .gitignore
│   │       └── ...
│   └── ...
└── <b>Hard</b>
    ├── [problem_name]
    │   ├── README.md
    │   ├── [problem_name].py
    │   └── <b>others</b>
    │       ├── .gitignore
    │       └── ...
    └── ...
</pre>

The problems are categorized into three main difficulty levels: **`Easy`**, **`Medium`**, and **`Hard`**. Within each difficulty level, the problems are further organized into separate directories, with each directory representing a specific problem.

Each problem directory contains:
  - **`README.md`**: The question itself and it's representative link to LeetCode (click on title).
  - **`[problem_name].py`**: At last one code solution to the question.
  - **`others`**: Just a folder to store a ***.gitignore*** and other miscellaneous files.
