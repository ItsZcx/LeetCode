# LeetCode Solutions
Welcome to my LeetCode Solutions Repository! This repository is dedicated to storing my personal solutions to various LeetCode problems that I have solved. It serves as a reference for my coding journey and showcases my problem-solving skills.

# Introduction
LeetCode is a popular online platform that provides a collection of coding challenges, ranging from easy to hard, to help individuals enhance their programming skills. This repository contains my own solutions to these challenges, which I have developed over time.

By sharing my solutions, I aim to provide insights into different approaches, algorithms, and data structures that can be used to solve a wide range of programming problems. However, it's important to note that these solutions reflect my own thought process and may not always be the most optimal or efficient ones.

# Organization
The folders are organized as follows:

```
.
├── Easy
│   ├── [problem_name]
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   └── [problem_name].py
│   │   └── .gitignore
│   └── ...
├── Medium
│   ├── [problem_name]
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   └── [problem_name].py
│   │   └── .gitignore
│   └── ...
└── Hard
    ├── [problem_name]
    │   ├── README.md
    │   └── [problem_name].py
    │   └── .gitignore
    └── ...
```

The problems are categorized into three main difficulty levels: **`Easy`**, **`Medium`**, and **`Hard`**. Within each difficulty level, the problems are further organized into separate directories, with each directory representing a specific problem.

Each problem directory contains:
  - **`README.md`**: The question itself and it's representative link to LeetCode (click on title).
  - **`[problem_name].py`**: At last one code solution to the question.
  - **`.gitignore`**: Just a .gitignore in case I don't want to push whatever.
